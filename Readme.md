## Research Interests

During my undergraduate, I followed my supervisor who focused more on ecohydrology in semiarid areas in China. And the transfer mechanism of the atmosphere-plant-soil appeals to me so much. At that time, I learned to use numercial models to do the deep analysis concerning the shrub encroachment in Inner Mongolia. 
Now, I am still very interested about our whole ecosystem. Besides, I realzied the importance to seek for a tradeoff between economic development and ecological sustainability. And learning to use models can be one of the most effective tools to help us judge whether we have already understood the mechanisms of our nature. I hope to do research with the combination of the observations and models in the future. And that is why I overcome my fear of computing programming and get ready to learn python well no matter how hard it is!
